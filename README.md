# dailPad
This dial pad view controller doesnâ€™t have autlayout.
The constraints are set programmatically in the code.
This dial pad has audio tune similar to iPhone dial pad audio tune for each number button.
If you need to use this in your code then you can make a separate storyboard for this and call this view controller.
